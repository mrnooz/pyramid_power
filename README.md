processing bg with pyramids

This Processing script creates an animated 3D scene with multiple rotating wireframe pyramids in a grid and a large, solid pyramid at the center. The smaller wireframe pyramids are randomly placed and rotate at different speeds, while the large central pyramid has one white face and the other faces in shades of gray, rotating around the X and Y axes. The large pyramid is also positioned further back along the Z-axis to avoid intersection with the smaller pyramids.

The script is organized into three main sections: global variables and setup, the main draw loop, and two custom classes for handling the small and large pyramids. The Pyramid class is responsible for the small wireframe pyramids, while the BigPyramid class handles the large, solid pyramid at the center of the screen. Both classes have methods for updating the rotation and displaying the pyramid on the screen. The main draw loop iterates over the small pyramids, updating and displaying them, and then updates and displays the large pyramid.
